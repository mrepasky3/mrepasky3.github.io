<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
I am a [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. candidate in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yao Xie](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/). My interests are at the intersection of **generative modeling, high-dimensional statistics, planetary geophysics**. My doctoral research has focused on leveraging deep learning tools for statistical modeling and problem solving. This has included the development of a deep neural network optimization strategy for goodness-of-fit hypothesis testing and a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy to select within combinatorial action spaces under stochastic state transitions.

I am interested in applications to the natural sciences, including planetary science, energy systems, and materials. My research in collaboration with Dr. Xie is also focused on: developing methods to detect corrosion in coated materials to reduce the environmental impact of the coating industry, physically characterizing and denoising high-dimensional scanning probe microscopy data, and categorizing failures in a power grid given sensor array data. During my internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and under the supervision of Dr. Erwan Mazarico, I applied generative AI tools to improve the resolution of planetary topography data given simulated optical measurements from satellite orbiters.

In May 2021, I earned a BS in Physics with a concentration in [Astrophysics](https://cra.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech. Working in the [Computational Cosmology Group](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/) run by [Dr. John Wise](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/members/john-wise/) as an undergraduate student, I managed and analyzed cosmological simulations of stellar clusters in the early universe run on supercomputers at Georgia Tech [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu/) and the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2)).

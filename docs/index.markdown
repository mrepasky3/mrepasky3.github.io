I am a first-year [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. student at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yao Xie](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/). I have broad interests in machine learning as it's applied to physics and for social good, including topics in spatial-temporal modelling, reinforcement learning, and simulation.

I am a first-year [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. student at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yao Xie](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/). I have broad interests in machine learning as it's applied to physics and for social good, including topics in spatial-temporal modelling, reinforcement learning, and simulation. Currently, my research in collaboration with Dr. Xie is focused on: developing methods to detect corrosion in coated materials to reduce the environmental impact of the coating industry, studying fair and efficient policing strategies using RL, and physically characterizing and denoising high-dimensional scanning probe microscopy data.

In May 2021, I earned a BS in Physics with a concentration in [Astrophysics](https://cra.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech. Working in the [Computational Cosmology Group](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/) run by [Dr. John Wise](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/members/john-wise/), I worked on cosmological simulations of stellar clusters in the early universe managed on supercomputers at Georgia Tech [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu/) and the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2)).

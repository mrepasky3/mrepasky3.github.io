<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
I am a third-year [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. student at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yao Xie](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/). My interests are at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning. My most recent work focuses on developing an optimization strategy to compute the Stein discrepancy for statistical hypothesis testing in high-dimensional spaces. I focus on applications to the natural sciences, including planetary science, energy systems, and materials. My research in collaboration with Dr. Xie is also focused on: developing methods to detect corrosion in coated materials to reduce the environmental impact of the coating industry, studying fair and efficient policing strategies using RL, and physically characterizing and denoising high-dimensional scanning probe microscopy data.

In May 2021, I earned a BS in Physics with a concentration in [Astrophysics](https://cra.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech. Working in the [Computational Cosmology Group](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/) run by [Dr. John Wise](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/members/john-wise/) as an undergraduate student, I managed and analyzed cosmological simulations of stellar clusters in the early universe run on supercomputers at Georgia Tech [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu/) and the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2)).

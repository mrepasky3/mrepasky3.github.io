I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech. I have broad interests in machine learning as it's applied to physics and for social good, including topics in spatial-temporal modelling, reinforcement learning, and simulation.

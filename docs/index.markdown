<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
I am a [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. candidate in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech advised by [Dr. Yao Xie](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/). My interests are at the intersection of **generative modeling, high-dimensional statistics, and planetary geophysics**. My doctoral research has focused on leveraging deep learning tools for statistical modeling. Recently, I have been developing generative modeling to solve problems related to posterior sampling and inverse problems. This includes an ongoing collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop a super-resolution technique for lunar topograhy models.  

During my Ph.D., I have developed novel methods for solving problems in statistics and decision making. This includes:  
(1) A posterior sampling method to [sample within the noise space of pre-trained generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02078).  
(2) A multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy to select within combinatorial action spaces under stochastic state transitions, with an [application to patrol and dispatch operations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02246).  
(3) A [neural neural statistical goodness-of-fit optimization technique](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10196354) which can localize regions of poor fit in models of probability distributions, [such as generative models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10445927).  

I am primarily interested in applications to the natural sciences, including planetary science, energy systems, and materials. Such applications include the development of methods to [model and detect corrosion in coated materials](https://onepetro.org/amppcorr/proceedings-abstract/AMPP24/AMPP24/556754) to reduce the environmental impact of the coating industry and a technique for [physically characterizing and denoising high-dimensional scanning probe microscopy data](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_QNr9Y8oYx).  

During my internships at [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/) and under the supervision of [Dr. Erwan Mazarico](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/erwan.m.mazarico), I trained [generative AI models to improve the resolution of planetary topography data](https://seal.ae.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2024-09/RepaskyMatthew.pdf) given simulated optical measurements from satellite orbiters. As an intern at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) under the supervision of [Dr. Feng Qiu](https://www.anl.gov/profile/feng-qiu), I developed a low-rank tensor modeling scheme to [categorize failures in a power grid given sensor array data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476907).  

In May 2021, I earned a BS in Physics with a concentration in [Astrophysics](https://cra.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech, working in the [Computational Cosmology Group](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/) run by [Dr. John Wise](https://cosmo.gatech.edu/members/john-wise/).
